# Text Mining Project

## Greek Mythology Project

## Abstract
(This is a first draft of our abstract, with the main idea of our project and our motivation for it. It is subject to change as it will be updated as the project unfolds.)
In this project, we aim to determine in what way gods and mortals are described in Greek mythology, and how these descriptions differ from each other. In Greek mythology, gods are often portrayed with human traits; they make mistakes, have human-like relationships and feel the same emotions as mortals. We want to know whether this is also reflected in the words used to describe them, or whether there is a very clear distinction between the descriptors of gods and humans.
This project will analyze the adjectives and adverbs that describe god characters in Greek mythology texts, and compare this with the way that mortal characters are represented. 
We decided to work on Greek mythology because of our interest in Greek myths, and thought that analyzing these myths would be a great application of the material from class. 

## Research questions
In what way are Gods portrayed differently than mortals in Greek Mythology? 

## Dataset
In order to encompass a better overview, we will be studying multiple different myths about Greek gods and mortals from the following text library: https://www.theoi.com/Library.html
To be able to compare gods and humans, we will first label the characters in the story as either of the two. We will create a list of humans from Greek mythology, and of gods. Then, we will go through the texts and label each character as being either a god or human.
